## ABOUT ME

Hi. My name's Mariya. I'm 26 y.o. 
I worked as actress and children animator some years ago. I always liked to work with people. But I had to change my job and way of development because of the lockdown in 2020. It was the perfect time to find myself and new opportunities. I de—Åided to try Web development. It turned out to be very interesting for me. It's very cool you can see what you do in real time to opening browser! 
Now I work as HTML coder and copywriter. I don't regret to change jobs, becouse I like to learn programming logic. I believe, that my soft-skills and ability to learn new will help me to become good Frontend Developer.
