## ABOUT ME

Hi. My name is Mariya. I'm 26 y.o.
I've always loved to work with people. That is why I've worked as an actress and children animator for several years. But lockdown in 2020 changed my life. I lost my job, so I decided to change my way of development and started to study Web development. And I have to say that it was a perfect time to find myself and new opportunities, because it's so cool to see results of your work just by opening your browser!
Now I work as an HTML coder and a copywriter. I don't regret I changed my job, because it turned out that I love learning programmic logic and find it very interesting.

I believe that my soft-skills and ability to learn new information will help me to become a good Frontend Developer.
